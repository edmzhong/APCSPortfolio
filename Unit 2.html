	<h1>I Have A Dream</h1>

	<p id="Question">Q1:In your own words, describe what event driven programming is. What event handler was used in the I Have a Dream app? How was it used? </p>
			  <p id="Answer">A1:Event driven programming is a programming where the program's behavior is controlled by the written code and how it responds to certain events such as button clicks.
				  In the I Have a Dream app, buttons were used to make the player play the speech from Martin Luther King Jr. 
			  </p>
		<p id="Question">Q2:Is it possible to create an app without event driven programming? Explain.</p>
			  <p id="Answer">A2:It is possible to create an app without event driven programming, but it will not have many options or functions like other apps. The functionality will be very limited. </p>
		<p id="Question">Q3:What elements and components make up the User Interface (UI) for the I Have A Dream app?</p>
			  <p id="Answer">A3:The elements and components that make up the UI was a black background, the MLK picture, and two labels, the title and the speech caption.</p>
		<p id="Question">Q4:What are some of the elements that make up the UI for a car? A vending machine?</p>
			  <p id="Answer">A4:Elements that make up the UI for a car is a dashboard, fuel meter, milage meter, speedometer, steering wheels, radio controls, A/C buttons, and more. A vending machine
				  is basically a display with letters and buttons for choosing what you want. It also has a change dispenser and bill acceptor.

	<h1>Mobile Devices and Apps: Hardware and Software</h1>

	<p id="Question">Q1:Give an example of a special purpose computer that you are familiar with and briefly describe its hardware and its software.</p>
		<p id="Answer">A1:ATM machines are an example of a special purpose computer and its hardware is a giant box with a card acceptor and change dispenser. The software allows you to access your card when
				you plug it in and choose how much money to take out.
			</p>
	<p id="Question">Q2:Explain in your own words the difference between running your app by "Connecting to the Companion" and running your app by "Packaging" it.</p>
		<p id="Answer">A2:"Connecting to the Companion" allows the MIT Companion to transfer and translate the software of App Inventor into an app that the Android can understand and run.
				"Packaging" the app allows the App Inventor code to be translated into binary code where it will turn into an .apk file which an Android can download and run easily.
			</p>
	<p id="Question">Q3:As we learned in this lesson, a byte is about the same amount of memory as a character, such as the letter 't'. There are approximately 7 million characters in all of the Harry Potter novels combined.
		 How many bytes of memory would all of the Harry Potter novels take up? How many copies of the Harry Potter novels would fit on a 7 Gigabyte flash drive. (Remember 1 Gigabyte is 1 billion bytes.)</p>
		<p id="Answer">A3:If 1 character = 1 byte, then all of the Harry Potter novels will take up around 7 million bytes. Now 1 gigabyte = 1 billion bytes, so 7,000,000,000 bytes / 7,000,000 bytes = 1000 which is the answer to
				 the number of copies of Harry Potter novels that will fit onto a 7 gigabyte drive. </p>

	<h1>What is Abstraction?</h1>

	<p id="Question">Q1:Write an explanation of abstraction, including at least one example, in your own words.</p>
	<p id="Answer">A1:It is a simplified idea of something complex. An example of an abstraction is a blueprint of a building because it gives a general idea on how the building will look like and where everything will go.</p>
	<p id="Question">Q2:Give 2-3 examples of abstractions in everyday life not identified in the lecture.</p>
	<p id="Answer">A2:Doll houses are abstractions of mansions and giant houses, they are just smaller and made as toys for kids. Another example of abstractions are the plays in sports of football, basketball, and more. 
		They are simplified small ideas of how players will run the game and try their best to win, it shows the basic information for what the role of each player has to do.
	</p>
	<p id="Question">Q3:Consider an example of software, a mobile application, or a web site and explain how it is an abstraction.</p>
	<p id="Answer">A3:<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and its search engine is an abstraction since it allows the searcher to find what they want and what is relevant to them. It allows the user to view
	what they searched for and the engine breaks everything down and tracks for what they want. The user sees it as a simple idea of typing and searching, but in reality the web site is sorting everything out and finding
	the most appropriate and relevant answer to their search. </p>

	<h1>Hardware Abstractions: Logic Gates</h1>

<p id="Question">Q1:(POGIL) Insert a screenshot of your Logicly diagram for the Exclusive-OR circuit below.</p>
	<p id="Answer">A1:<center><img src="Images/ExclusiveOR.png"></center></p>
<p id="Question">Q2:(POGIL) Consider these three things: The OR gate (i.e., the physical circuit), the Boolean OR function (as defined by its truth table), and the OR symbol. 
	How would arrange them from most abstract to least abstract? And what criterion would you use to determine their order?</p>
	<p id="Answer">A2:<h1>Most abstract to least abstract: </h1>
			<ul>The OR Symbol, the Boolean/function, OR Gate </ul> <br>  
	<p>To determine their order, we used abstraction and the simplified ideas of it. The symbol is an abstract text, gate is an image, and the OR function is a table that represents true/false.
			</p>
<p id="Question">Q3:Consider these three things: A binary digit (e.g., 1 or 0), the flip-flop circuit diagram (), and the flip-flop circuit (i.e., the physical circuit). 
	How would you arrange them from most abstract to least abstract and what criterion would you use to determine their order?</p>
	<p id="Answer">A3:<h1>Most abstract to least abstract:</h1>
		<ul>A binary digit, flip-flop circuit diagram, and the flip-flop circuit.</ul>
	<p>I determined their order by also abstraction. Binary digits are numbers but can be represented in many different ways with different ideas, flip-flop circuit diagram is the blueprint of the circuit and can't really be 
		seen directly or described, and flip-flop circuit can be easily shown by pictures and see it step by step on how it works. </p>

	<h1>Impacts of CS: The Digital Explosion</h1>

	<p id="Question">Q1:What is a bit and what does it mean to say that "it's all just bits"? (Koan 1) Give examples of the things today that are stored in bits?</p>
		<p id="Answer">A1:A bit is a really small unit of information that can be seen as 0 or 1. The meaning of "it's just all bits" means the whole thing on the computer are just bits combined and how they form together
			to get what we see today on a computer. Examples of things that are stored in bits are songs of Spotify, Youtube videos, library books online, DMV records, and more!</p>
	<p id="Question">Q2:Describe, in your own words, Moore's Law.</p>
		<p id="Answer">A2:Moore's Law is the law on how the speed and processing power of computers will double every couple of years. So every few years, computers will become more and more powerful than
			before.</p>
	<p id="Question">Q3:Give an example of how the digital explosion is "neither good nor bad" but has both positive and negative implications.</p>
		<p id="Answer">A3:An example of digital explosion is location tracking and it can have both positive and negative implications. Location tracking can save lives and help people in danger during emergencies, but 
			it can also be potentially bad as it can allow others to stalk, follow, and access to the location on where you are. There are pros and cons, but overall it is seen more as "neither good nor bad". </p>
	<p id="Question">Q4:Find and summarize a news article that talks about the positive or negative impacts of a computing innovation. Is the technology itself positive or negative? 
		Or have people used the technology in positive and/or negative ways?  Don't forget to LINK to your article!</p>
		<p id="Answer">A4:A <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/forget-navi-ryzen-amd-leadership/">news article </a> I chose was about the company Advanced Micro Devices(AMD) and their new CPUs that they released, the Ryzen 3000s. This technology overall was positive as it allowed more
			competition into the computer world of CPUs and how they are two major companies for it now, AMD and Intel. Now the market isn't full dominated by Intel and is a competition between both with many different
			price points and options for many in the world. People probably had used the technology in both positive and negative ways, positive in gaming, editing, doing their jobs, and negatively as maybe hacking, doing
			illegal things, and more. </p>
